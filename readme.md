# Hideout Furniture
Created for [S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/), this adds various objects that can be bought and crafted, including light sources, stashes, a portable workshop, a radio, and a playable piano, and can be placed in the world through a primitive base-building system.
